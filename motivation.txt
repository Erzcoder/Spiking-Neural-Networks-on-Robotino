Why do you want to use SNNs to move along the line instead of easier lane-following techniques?



- proof of concept that SNNS can be applied to mobile robotics
- early guessing of the output before the whole input sequence has been presented to the network
	--> together with DVS it allows for much faster reaction times
- depends on earlier input not only on the current state --> smoother trajectories
- learning -> 
- Neuromorphic hardware for SNNs is much more energy efficient -> good for mobile robots + better suited for parellelization

- sensorimotor mapping
